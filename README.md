# Recommender_System
•  Built a Recommender system with Stacked Autoencoder on MovieLens 100k dataset using PyTorch framework.
• Converted the data into torch tensors and used three hidden layers of 20, 10 and 20 nodes with sigmoid activation function.
• Achieved test loss of 0.98 and did hyperparameter optimization to get the best parameters and reduce the error to 0.94
